# Operation Overkill
Source code for operation overkill

## What is Op Overkill and why should you care?

Op Overkill (OpK) was born out of necessity when I needed to move water from the side of my house to prevent flooding in the basement.  It was suggested that my solution was a bit of an overkill which made me think, no, but now I want to design a proper operation overkill.

Why care? Don't, it will mean nothing to you, it is a bit of fun for me, you will end up aimlessly staring at a website watching number change until a water pump or two are switched on and off automatically using an arduino device.

## How it works

There are 2 arduino's one connected to the pumps and one to my server.  The one connected to the pumps sends out RF to the server connected one, this is opened in an IIS app (c#) and the results sent to the website.
